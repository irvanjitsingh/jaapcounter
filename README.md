# Jaap Counter

This is a simple **MeteorJS** app that lets you keep track of counts online with your friends.

# Usage
Configure a Meteor app online, and deploy using Meteor's provided service. Check out [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/) for details.

**The motivation for this was to provide an online interface for a Jaap count for reading Bani, or an Ang counter for Sehaj Paaths.**
